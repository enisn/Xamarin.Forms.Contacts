# Obsolete
This library is obsolete and doesn't target newer versions of Android & iOS. 

I strongly recommend to use [Xamarin.Essentials](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials) to read contacts.

# Xamarin.Forms.Contacts

</a>

Easy usage in Portable Project:

```csharp
var contacts = await Plugin.ContactService.CrossContactService.Current.GetContactListAsync();
```


You can generate ObservableCollection like that:


```csharp
var contacts = await Plugin.ContactService.CrossContactService.Current.GetContactListAsync();

ObservableCollection<Contact> = new ObservableCollection<Contact>(contacts);

```


You can use filter like that:


```csharp
var contacts = await Plugin.ContactService.CrossContactService.Current.GetContactListAsync(x=>x.Emails.Count > 0);
```


DO NOT FORGET ADD THIS PERMISSIONS:

# ANDROID
```
READ_CONTACTS
```

# iOS
If you don't have mac connection you should Right Click the **Info.plist** and Open With XML editor.
Add this key into **<dict>**
```xml
	<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
	<string>We need contact permission to do ...</string>
```
